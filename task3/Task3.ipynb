For  example in Saudia Arabia, it is not fair to allow women the right to  work but still keep the rule that womens personal income is solely for  her, and that a man is legally obliged to provide for her as well as the  social pressure to do so also. Also women cannot not keep the rule  where their money is solely theirs and not their husbands, and then  still expect larger inheritances. That kind of change is what (most)  feminists would do if they got involved (western ones wont anyway apart  from to talk about it), as they would only focus on womens issues such  as right to work, yet ignore obligation to be guaranteed finanicially  looked after. I am not speculating, similar things happened right from  1st wave feminism (and \\[some\\] feminists did this on purpose e.g. took  property that they acquired the legal right to but the MEN still had the  responsiblity of the tax for, and some men went to jail for not being  able to afford their wifes property, which they would still keep and  would not sell)\"\n",

Personally, I regret absolutely nothing.  It's amazing the emotional roller coaster that you go through once you do have kids to take care of.  I never imagined it possible to love anyone as much as I love these 2 little guys.  As a man there is a much deeper sense of meaning in your life that is discovered once you're a father and you would literally die for your kids without even thinking for a second.  The responsibility to take care of them and provide for them makes life so much more meaningful and fulfilling and that in itself provides a deep sense of purpose and happiness that I didn't know was possible.   This doesn't exist in a life where your only purpose is immediate gratification and pleasure seeking.  That will get old very quick and the inevitable existential crisis will be just around the corner.  Jordan Peterson's work has really shone a light on that for me.\n",

For  example in Saudia Arabia, it is not fair to allow women the right to  work but still keep the rule that womens personal income is solely for  her, and that a man is legally obliged to provide for her as well as the  social pressure to do so also. Also women cannot not keep the rule  where their money is solely theirs and not their husbands, and then  still expect larger inheritances. That kind of change is what (most)  feminists would do if they got involved (western ones wont anyway apart  from to talk about it), as they would only focus on womens issues such  as right to work, yet ignore obligation to be guaranteed finanicially  looked after. I am not speculating, similar things happened right from  1st wave feminism (and \\[some\\] feminists did this on purpose e.g. took  property that they acquired the legal right to but the MEN still had the  responsiblity of the tax for, and some men went to jail for not being  able to afford their wifes property, which they would still keep and  would not sell)\"\n",

All the Pacino, Eastwood, Cruise, Hardy, Bale, Pitt, and a couple of DiCaprio and Gosling characters. Their characters are typically men of few words. Confident. Stoic. Smooth. Stylish. Guys like these can probably have any girl they want, but there is a common trope in movies that they will try to win over the girl who was initially cold to them. James Bond is actually the perfect example now that I think about it. Has less to do with the girl (or guy) itself and more to do with the \"chase\" of winning him or her over.

Personally, I regret absolutely nothing.  It's amazing the emotional roller coaster that you go through once you do have kids to take care of.  I never imagined it possible to love anyone as much as I love these 2 little guys.  As a man there is a much deeper sense of meaning in your life that is discovered once you're a father and you would literally die for your kids without even thinking for a second.  The responsibility to take care of them and provide for them makes life so much more meaningful and fulfilling and that in itself provides a deep sense of purpose and happiness that I didn't know was possible.   This doesn't exist in a life where your only purpose is immediate gratification and pleasure seeking.  That will get old very quick and the inevitable existential crisis will be just around the corner.  Jordan Peterson's work has really shone a light on that for me.\n",
